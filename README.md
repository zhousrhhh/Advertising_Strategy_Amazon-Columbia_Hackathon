# Amazon X Columbia Hackathon (Amazon Advertising Strategy Analysis)

This is a Hackathon co-organised by Amazon and Columbia University. 

Using a [dataset](Columbia_Hackathon_Data_Dogfood.xlsx) with dogfood sales transaction data on Amazon, we need to define a score to measure advertising appropriateness. I've attached the [code](Pre-process-code.Rmd) for analysis and the [presentation slides](Mars Group_WOOF Advertising Pitch Deck_Amazon x Columbia Hackathon.pdf) of project results. 

Requirements:
1. The definition of appropriateness is up to us. But we must present only one function/model to determine its values.
2. We must have a definitive set of features as input for WOOF. We can choose as few or as many features as we see fit.
3. We must explain our proposed process and sample results of our efforts through a PowerPoint presentation.
4. We must then consolidate our collective results into a narrative that fits into a 5-minute [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xZD5gWvCPI&ab_channel=aw3494).
